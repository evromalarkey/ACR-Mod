Radajev společně s Kazbekovem a Kasunem jsou za katrem, ale hrstka zbývajících milicí se zakopala kdesi v lesích. Poslední tábor se podařilo lokalizovat pomocí UAV od spojenců a snímky ukazují, že se v táboře soustředí nejen poslední bojovníci, ale také technika, kterou zachránili před průzkumnými týmy. Pokud se nám podaří úkol splnit, mohl by to být konec bojů i když etnické napětí tu zůstane zakořeněno navždy.</Czech>

          <Czech>V roce, kdy vrcholila občanská válka v Bystřici, probíhala i válka ve východním Takistánu. Fanatický nepřítel vylámal zuby nejedné jednotce, která se tu pokusila bojovat. Mezinárodní spojenecké síly i přesto uspěly, alespoň částečně. Podařilo se vybudovat základny a udržet kus území pod kontrolou. Naše jednotky tu zajišťovaly leteckou podporu speciálních operací, a v terénu běhali kluci z 601. </Czech>
