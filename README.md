About
===========
I would like to introduce you our long going czech community project, it was annouced year ago on armaholic, but since then there wasn't much progress. 
Few months back we re-annouced it here on BI forums and since then we made huge progress and few czech communities were testing the mod privately, but today we would like to release it for everyone!

This mod contains various infantry units, weapons and equipment. Weapons are ports from Arma 2 and part of CUP. Vehicles are also ports from Arma 2.
Our goal is to include all of the content from the Arma 2 ACR DLC in Arma 3 standards.
