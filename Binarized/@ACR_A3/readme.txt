About-
===========
I would like to introduce you our long going czech community project, it was annouced year ago on armaholic, but since then there wasn't much progress. 
Few months back we re-annouced it here on BI forums and since then we made huge progress and few czech communities were testing the mod privately, but today we would like to release it for everyone!

This mod containts various infantry units, weapons and equipment. Weapons are ports from Arma 2 and they're using animations from @hlcmods_core, but there still need to be some work done. 
For now the main focus was on units and weapons. Later we will maybe bring some of the vehicles from A2. 
Until then you can use some replacement configs for example Mi24 (@kae_sz) and Mi17(@cha_mi8) helicopters which are included in opt folder.
